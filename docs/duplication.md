# Model duplication

Decoy implements [Cloner](https://github.com/BKWLD/cloner) to allow admins to duplicate models.  A single model and it's files should work right out of the box.  To support cloning relationships, specify a `$cloneable_relations` array on the model.  Read the Cloner docs for more info and some other options.
